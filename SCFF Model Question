1. For the 2019-20 estimation, in the example excel given, base allocation is calculated based on 2019-20 projections, while supplemental and success allocations are based on 2018-19 projections. Is this the proper way to calculate ths SCFF? or was this an intermediary solution until 2018-19 figures were known so 2019-20 projections could be estimated?
2. Why are some parts of the calculation based on 3-year averages while others are based on single-year figures?
3. Base Allocation growth rate assumption is 2/3 1-year prior absolute growth + 1/3 2-year prior absolute growth.
   Supplemental Allocation growth rate assumption is 1-year prior absolute growth.
   Success Allocation growth rate assumption is 1-year prior absolute growth.
   Q1) Is there a reason different growth assumptions are used for different parts of the formula?
   Q2) If no, does it make sense to do 2/3 1-year prior growth RATE + 1/3 2-year prior growth RATE (instead of 			absolute growth)?
4. Discuss incorporating Differential Districts into the model
